# Spec Summary (Lite)

Replace all hardcoded absolute paths (`/Users/caio.niehues/CodeProjects/`) with dynamic path resolution to ensure the Obsidian plugin works correctly when installed in any vault on any user's system. This fix is essential for plugin distribution, cross-platform compatibility, and enabling other developers to contribute to the project.
